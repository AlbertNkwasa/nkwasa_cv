Yet, the water balance of cultivated areas is strongly influenced by applied management practices (e.g. planting, irrigation, fertilization, harvesting). The SWAT+ model represents agricultural land by default in a generic way where the start of the cropping season is driven by accumulated heat units. However, this approach does not work for tropical and sub-tropical regions such as the sub-Saharan Africa where crop growth dynamics are mainly controlled by rainfall rather than temperature. In this study, we present an approach on how to incorporate crop phenology using decision tables and global datasets of rainfed and irrigated croplands with the associated cropping calendar and fertilizer applications in a regional SWAT+ model for Northeast Africa.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We evaluate the influence of the crop phenology representation on simulations of Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Evapotranspiration (ET) using LAI remote sensing data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and WaPOR ET data respectively. Results show that a representation of crop phenology using global datasets leads to improved temporal patterns of LAI and ET simulations especially for regions with a single cropping cycle. However, for regions with multiple cropping seasons, global phenology datasets need to be complemented with local data or remote sensing data to capture additional cropping seasons. In addition, the improvement of the cropping season also helps to improve soil erosion estimates, as the timing of crop cover controls erosion rates in the model. With more realistic growing seasons, soil erosion is largely reduced for most agricultural Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs) which can be considered as a move towards substantial improvements over previous estimates. We conclude that regional and global hydrological models can benefit from improved representations of crop phenology and the associated management practices. Future work regarding the incorporation of multiple cropping seasons in global phenology data is needed to better represent cropping cycles in regional to global hydrological models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the default models, agricultural land cover is represented by a single growing cycle. However, agricultural land use, especially in African cultivated catchments, typically consists of several cropping seasons, following dry and wet seasonal patterns, and are hence incorrectly represented in SWAT and SWAT+ default models. In this paper, we propose a procedure to incorporate agricultural seasonal land-use dynamics by (1) mapping land-use trajectories instead of static land-cover maps and (2) linking these trajectories to agricultural management settings. This approach was tested in SWAT and SWAT+ models of Usa catchment in Tanzania that is intensively cultivated by implementing dominant dynamic trajectories. Our results were evaluated with remote-sensing observations for Leaf Area Index (LAI), which showed that a single growing cycle did not well represent vegetation dynamics. A better agreement was obtained after implementing seasonal land-use dynamics for cultivated HRUs. It was concluded that the representation of seasonal land-use dynamics through trajectory implementation can lead to improved temporal patterns of LAI in default models. The SWAT+ model had higher flexibility in representing agricultural practices, using decision tables, and by being able to represent mixed cropping cultivations.},

Study focus
Several studies have shown a relationship between climate change and changes in sediment yield. However, there are limited modeling applications that study this relationship at regional scales mainly due to data availability and computational cost. This study proposes a methodological framework using the SWAT+ model to predict and project sediment yield at a regional scale in data-scarce regions using global datasets. We implement a framework that (a) incorporates topographic factors from high/medium resolution DEMs (b) incorporates crop phenology data (c) introduces an areal threshold to linearize sediment yield in large model units and (d) apply a hydrological mass balance calibration. We test this methodology in the Nile Basin using a model application with (revised) and without (default) the framework under historical and future climate projections.
New hydrological insights for the region
Results show improved sediment yield estimates in the revised model, both in absolute values and spatial distribution when compared to measured and reported estimates. The contemporary long term (1989 – 2019) annual mean sediment yield in the revised model was 1.79 t ha−1 yr−1 and projected to increase by 61 \% (44 \% more than the default estimates) in the future period (2071 – 2100), with the greatest sediment yield increase in the eastern part of the basin. Thus, the proposed framework improves and influences modeled and predicted sediment yield respectively.},

An additional cropping season is possible when irrigation is applied during the dry season, which could result in three cropping seasons. However, most studies using agro-hydrological models such as the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to map blue and green evapotranspiration (ET) do not account for these cropping seasons. Blue ET is a portion of crop evapotranspiration after irrigation application, while green ET is the evapotranspiration resulting from rainfall. In this paper, we derived dynamic and static trajectories from seasonal land use maps to represent the land use dynamics following the major growing seasons to improve simulated blue and green water consumption from simulated evapotranspiration in SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater}. A comparison between the default SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater} set-up (with static land use representation) and a dynamic SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater} model set-up (with seasonal land use representation) is made by a spatial mapping of the ET results. Additionally, the SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater} blue and green ET were compared with the results from the four remote sensing data-based methods, namely SN (Senay), EK (van Eekelen), the Budyko method, and soil water balance method (SWB). The results show that ET with seasonal representation is closer to remote sensing estimates, giving higher performance than ET with static land use representation. The root mean squared error decreased from 181 to 69 mm yr{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, the percent bias decreased from 20 \% to 13 \%, and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency increased from {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}−{\textless}/span{\textgreater}0.46 to 0.4. Furthermore, the blue and green ET results from the dynamic SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater} model were compared to the four remote sensing methods. The results show that the SWAT{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}+{\textless}/span{\textgreater} blue and green ET are similar to the van Eekelen method and performed better than the other three remote sensing methods. It is concluded that representation of seasonal land use dynamics produces better ET results, which provide better estimations of blue and green agricultural water consumption.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While different modeling frameworks offer advantages and disadvantages, System Dynamics (SD) models have seen sustained use as a stakeholder-friendly approach for water resources modelling. In contrast, physically-based models are more appropriate to model the hydrological components of coupled human-water systems. Proposed as a way to combine the relative strengths of both modelling paradigms, model coupling allows researchers to build participatory SD models with stakeholders, while delegating the hydrological components of the overall model to an external hydrological model. Recently developed to facilitate model coupling, the Tinam\&iuml;t Python package presents an extensible outward-facing Application Programming Interface (API). It allows for the development of extensions (wrappers) that expand compatibility with different physically-based models. However, no watershed hydrological model has yet been connected to this API. In the present study, a socket and JavaScript Object Notation-based communication protocol was developed with the goal of facilitating the coupling of models written in languages such as FORTRAN. This novel protocol served to develop a Tinam\&iuml;t-compatible wrapper for the hydrological model SWAT+, allowing it to be coupled to human-water SD models. The novel coupling protocol was then applied to a case study of Tanzania\&rsquo;s Usa Basin. This approach provides the modeler with the benefits of both physically-based and SD models, thereby allowing the detection of potential far-reaching effects of policy decisions, within a system that remains flexible and easily adaptable to other watersheds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Climate change poses a fundamental threat to agriculture within the Nile basin due to the magnitude of projected impacts and low adaptive capacity. So far, climate change impacts on agriculture for the basin have mostly been assessed for single-cropping systems, which may bias the results considering that the basin is dominated by different cropping systems, with about one-third of the crop area under double cropping. In this study, we simulate single- and double-cropping systems in the Nile basin and assess the climate change impacts on different cropping systems under two scenarios, i.e. “no adaptation” and “adaptation to a late-maturing cultivar”. We find that the mean crop yields of maize, soybean and wheat decrease with future warming without cultivar adaptation. We attribute this to the shortening of the growing season due to increased temperature. The decrease is stronger in all single-cropping systems (12.6–45.5\%) than in double-cropping systems (5.9–26.6\%). The relative magnitude of yield reduction varies spatially with the greatest reduction in the northern part of the basin experiencing the strongest warming. In a scenario with cultivar adaptation, mean crop yields show a stronger increase in double-cropping systems (14.4–35.2\%) than single-cropping systems (8.3–13.7\%). In this scenario, farmers could possibly benefit from increasing cropping intensities while adapting to late-maturing cultivars. This study underscores the importance of accounting for multiple-cropping systems in agricultural assessments under climate change within the Nile basin.},

Anthropogenic climate change (CC) has changed the state of these water resources. Land use and land cover has also undergone significant changes due to the need to provide resources to a growing population. Yet, the impact of the Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) in addition to CC on the water resources of Africa is underexplored. Here we investigate how precipitation, evapotranspiration (ET), and river-flow respond to both CC and LULCC scenarios across the entire African continent. We set up a SWAT+ model for Africa and calibrated it using the Hydrological Mass Balance calibration (HMBC) methodology detailed in Chawanda et al., (2020a). The model was subsequently driven by an ensemble of bias-adjusted global climate models to simulate the hydrological cycle under a range of CC and LULCC scenarios. The results indicate that the Zambezi and the Congo River basins are likely to experience reduced river flows under CC by up to 7 \% decrease, while the Limpopo will likely have higher river flows. The Niger River basin is likely to experience the largest decrease in river flows in all of Africa due to CC. The Congo River basin has the largest difference in river flows between scenarios with (over 18 \% increase) and without LULCC (over 20 \% decrease). The projected changes have implications on agriculture and energy sectors and hence the livelihood of people on the continent. Our results highlight the need to adopt policies to halt global greenhouse gas emissions and to combat the current trend of deforestation to avoid the high combined impact of CC and LULCC on water resources in Africa.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In this Review, we assess the impacts of hydroclimatic extremes and multidecadal climate change on a wide range of water quality constituents to identify the key responses and driving mechanisms. Comparison of 965 case studies indicates that river water quality generally deteriorates under droughts and heatwaves (68\% of compiled cases), rainstorms and floods (51\%) and under long-term climate change (56\%). Also improvements or mixed responses are reported owing to counteracting mechanisms, for example, increased pollutant mobilization versus dilution during flood events. River water quality responses under multidecadal climate change are driven by hydrological alterations, rises in water and soil temperatures and interactions among hydroclimatic, land use and human drivers. These complex interactions synergistically influence the sources, transport and transformation of all water quality constituents. Future research must target tools, techniques and models that support the design of robust water quality management strategies, in a world that is facing more frequent and severe hydroclimatic extremes.},

	abstract = {Climate change is projected to increase the volatility of agricultural productivity within the Sub-Saharan Africa region. However, current knowledge of climate change impacts in this region is largely derived from coarse-grid global datasets that lack sufficient detail for local applications. The derived impacts are thus generalized across large spatial scales, with a limited representation the differential exposure across the region. It is thus necessary to conduct localized assessments to derive local vulnerabilities and develop context-specific mitigation strategies. This study utilizes downscaled outputs from regional climate models to quantify the effects of climate change on maize and sugarcane crops at catchment-scale, hereby the Nyando catchment in Kenya. The findings indicate that climate change will reduce the suitability of conditions to the growth of both crops, with sub-optimal conditions for maize increasing by up to 600\%. The analysis of crop yields show that maize yields are projected to decline by about 23.9\% under the RCP4.5 scenario and 29.4\% under RCP8.5. Sugarcane yields are similarly projected to decrease by 17.0\% and 28.6\% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. The underlying climatic changes suggest that future warming outweighs the effects of precipitation in explaining crop yield declines. More broadly, the methodology applied in this study can be readily adapted and utilized for agricultural areas throughout the Sub-Saharan region. By adopting this localized impact assessment approach policymakers and sector players will be empowered with information at a higher spatial detail which empowers targeted, region-specific adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT
Climate change's profound implications for Mediterranean agriculture underscores the urgency of adaptation strategies. These strategies, whether incentivized or farmer-driven, are pivotal in mitigating crop yield losses and harnessing evolving climatic conditions. While the influence of agronomic adaptations on crop yields is well-explored, the implications for water footprint and water balance components remain largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE
With this study, we aim to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems in the Ombrone catchment, Tuscany. We estimate the impacts of both climate change and adaptation strategies - also referred to as management changes - on crop yields, water footprint and water balance components by comparing simulations with historical and future climate and with and without adaptation strategies.
METHODS
A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT+) agro-hydrological model of the Ombrone catchment is calibrated for crop yields of durum wheat, sunflower and irrigated maize. The impacts of climate change are then assessed by forcing the calibrated model with climate data from five bias-corrected regional climate models under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Subsequently, we simulate six autonomous agronomic adaptation strategies (earlier and later sowing, supplemental irrigation, longer crop cycles, zero tillage and cover crops). We quantify their impacts on crop yield, water footprint and water balance components, such as evaporation, water yield and soil moisture.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Our findings reveal negligible and adverse impacts on crop yields under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 respectively. Agricultural systems show strong adaptive capabilities under both RCPs, particularly when multiple strategies are combined. The most impactful strategies include earlier sowing and extended cropping cycles. Supplemental irrigation and cover crops are beneficial only with specific combinations of climate models and RCPs. While management changes have limited impact on basin-scale water balance components, they induce an average 27\% reduction in water yield at the cropland scale, attributed to practices like zero tillage and cover crops.
SIGNIFICANCE
Despite the uncertain impacts of climate change, our research reveal that changing the management - hence applying adaptation strategies - will be sufficient to maintain or improve current crop yields. Furthermore, we also underscore the non-negligible influence of management changes related to conservation agriculture on water balance components in agricultural catchments. Future adaptation strategy assessments should encompass comprehensive integration to evaluate broader impacts on water resources.},

The isolated impacts of land use change and the combined impacts showed an increase in future total annual river flows. However, the isolated impacts of climate change showed a reduction in future total annual flow. The influence of land use changes on total annual runoff was more dominant than that of climate change. The results show that climate change is the dominant factor impacting future high-flow quantiles while future annual flow and extreme low-flow variations were attributed mainly to land use changes.

	abstract = {The Nile basin is the second largest basin in Africa and one of the regions experiencing high climatic diversity with variability of precipitation and deteriorating water resources. As climate change is affecting most of the hydroclimatic variables across the world, this study assesses whether historical changes in river flow and sediment loads at selected gauges in the Nile basin can be attributed to climate change. An impact attribution approach is employed by constraining a process-based model with a set of factual and counterfactual climate forcing data for 69 years (1951–2019), from the impact attribution setup of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a). To quantify the role of climate change, we use the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test to identify trends and calculate the differences in long-term mean annual river flow and sediment load simulations between a model setup using factual and counterfactual climate forcing data. Results for selected river stations in the Lake Victoria basin show reasonable evidence of a long-term historical increase in river flows (two stations) and sediment load (one station), largely attributed to changes in climate. In contrast, within the Blue Nile and Main Nile basins, there is a slight decrease of river flows at four selected stations under factual climate, which can be attributed to climate change, but no significant changes in sediment load (one station). These findings show spatial differences in the impacts of climate change on river flows and sediment load in the study area for the historical period.},

	abstract = {Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment loading in water bodies is crucial for effective water quality management. Remote sensing (RS) has emerged as a valuable and reliable tool for monitoring turbidity, which can provide insights into sediment dynamics in water bodies. In this study, we investigate the potential of turbidity data derived from RS to explain simulated spatial and temporal sediment loading patterns in the Lake Tana basin, Ethiopia. Utilizing existing RS lake turbidity data from Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) and simulated seasonal and multiyear trends of river sediment loadings into Lake Tana from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT + model), we estimate correlations at different river inlets into Lake Tana. The results reveal a strong positive correlation (R2 {\textgreater} 0.66) between the multiyear monthly average sediment load from inflow rivers and RS lake turbidity at most river inlets. This indicates that the simulated river sediment loads and lake turbidity at river inlets exhibit similar seasonal patterns. Notably, higher turbidity levels are observed at the river inlet with the highest sediment load export. These findings highlight the potential of RS turbidity products in characterizing temporal and spatial patterns of sediment loadings, particularly in data-scarce regions, contributing to a better understanding of water quality dynamics in such areas.},

	abstract = {The new scientific decade (2023-2032) of the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) aims at searching for sustainable solutions to undesired water conditions – whether it be too little, too much or too polluted. Many of the current issues originate from global change, while solutions to problems must embrace local understanding and context. The decade will explore the current water crises by searching for actionable knowledge within three themes: global and local interactions, sustainable solutions and innovative cross-cutting methods. We capitalise on previous IAHS Scientific Decades shaping a trilogy; from Hydrological Predictions (PUB) to Change and Interdisciplinarity (Panta Rhei) to Solutions (HELPING). The vision is to solve fundamental water-related environmental and societal problems by engaging with other disciplines and local stakeholders. The decade endorses mutual learning and co-creation to progress towards UN sustainable development goals. Hence, HELPING is a vehicle for putting science in action, driven by scientists working on local hydrology in coordination with local, regional, and global processes.},

	abstract = {The climate in the Mediterranean region is expected to become warmer and drier but future projections of precipitation are uncertain, especially in the Northern part. Additionally, the difficulty in determining the plant physiological responses caused by CO2 rising complicates the estimation of future evaporative demand, increasing the uncertainty of future aridity assessments. Vegetation responses to rising CO2 are expected to increase radiation use efficiency and reduce stomatal conductance, hence increasing plant’s water use efficiency. These effects are often neglected when estimating future drought and aridity. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of climate change and vegetation stomatal conductance reduction on projected water balance components and the resulting impact on aridity in a medium-sized catchment of Central Italy. We validate and couple a hydrological model with climate projections from five regional climate models and perform simulations considering the vegetation responses or not. Results show that their inclusion significantly affects potential evapotranspiration. The other water balance components, namely actual evapotranspiration, water yield, percolation, and irrigation, are also influenced but with less significant changes. Considering or not the CO2 suppression effect on stomatal conductance, coupled with the uncertainty related to precipitation, highly affects the estimation of future aridity as the future climate classification ranges from “humid” to “semi-arid” depending on the simulation and climate model, even if model outputs need to be evaluated cautiously with CO2 concentration higher than 660 ppm.},

	abstract = {Due to the continued increase in land use changes and changing climatic patterns in the Lake Victoria basin, understanding the impacts of these changes on the water quality of Lake Victoria is imperative for safeguarding the integrity of the freshwater ecosystem. Thus, we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of land cover, precipitation, and water quality changes in the Lake Victoria basin between 2000 and 2022 using global satellite products. Focusing on chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and turbidity (TUR) in Lake Victoria, we used statistical metrics (correlation coefficient, trend analysis, change budget, and intensity analysis) to understand the relationship between land use and precipitation changes in the basin with changes in Chl-a and TUR at two major pollution hotspots on the lake, i.e., Winam Gulf and Inner Murchison Bay (IMB). Results show that the Chl-a and TUR concentrations in the Winam gulf increase with increases in precipitation. Through increases in precipitation, the erosion risks are increased and transport of nutrients from land to the lake system, promoting algal growth and turbidity. In the IMB, Chl-a and TUR concentrations decrease with an increase in precipitation, possibly due to dilution, but peak during moderate rainfall. Interestingly, changes in land use and land cover (LULC) at 5-year intervals showed no substantial correlation with water quality changes at selected hotspots even though a broader LULC change analysis over the past two decades indicated a notable 300\% increase in built-up areas across the Lake Victoria basin. These findings underscore the dominant influence of precipitation changes over LULC changes on the water quality of Lake Victoria for the selected hotspot areas.},

To address this gap and improve our understanding of surface water quality, we introduce CoSWAT-WQ, a large-scale water quality model developed to simulate river water quality constituents of Total Nitrogen (TN) and Total Phosphorus (TP), across global and regional freshwater systems. CoSWAT-WQ, an adaptation of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), is run at a global scale, providing high-resolution simulations that capture spatial and daily temporal dynamics of riverine nutrient loads. Here, we describe the model's inputs, setup structure, processes, and evaluate its performance by comparing model outputs to in-situ water quality observations and other global nutrient models. CoSWAT-WQ achieves comparable ranges of river nutrient loads in comparison to other global nutrient models. Additionally, a normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) \&lt; 1 was achieved with in-situ observations at more than 80 \% of the gauging stations for TN and TP concentrations. However, there was a general weak underestimation of observed concentrations and variability as seen with low Kling\&ndash;Gupta efficiency (KGE) values for selected stations. Despite its limitations, the model enables the simulation of river TN and TP constituents at a global scale while keeping local relevance. CoSWAT-WQ\&rsquo;s modular setup allows coupling with sectoral models addressing lake systems, agricultural runoff, and aquatic biodiversity, thereby broadening its applicability for cross-sectoral assessments. The model outputs offer valuable data that can inform ecological risk assessments, human health evaluations, and policy decisions on global freshwater quality management.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 requires innovative and often disruptive approaches to address critical gaps in global water quality monitoring. The most recent SDG Indicator 6.3.2 (Proportion of bodies of water with good ambient water quality) progress report highlights a critical water quality data gap, with an urgent need for countries to strengthen their monitoring capacity and commence state water quality assessments and trends analysis. Earth Observation (EO) technologies hold immense potential to close that gap for SDG Indicator 6.3.2. However, limited awareness, lack of skill, and resource inequalities are some of the barriers which hinder EO's widespread adoption. We present insights from a unique 2024 workshop held at the University of Stirling, which convened diverse participants from academia, industry, NGOs, and international agencies and across disciplines, geographies, and sectors. Through creative and collective thinking approaches, they developed four actionable concepts: (1) Space Buzz: a media campaign to raise awareness of EO's value; (2) centralised EO access hubs to empower users and improve equality;(3) scalable education strategies for capacity building; and (4) an Intergovernmental Panel for Water Quality to enhance global coordination. Each concept derived from a synoptic creative process, demonstrating the uniqueness of thinking within the teams. To unlock the potential of EO for global water quality monitoring, we invite EO networks, funders, water resource managers and individuals to champion these concepts, and incorporate them into funding calls and proposals. Our findings underscore the importance of broader stakeholder engagement to reveal innovative solutions.},
